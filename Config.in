	  Say Y here if you wish to examine BusyBox internals while applets are
	  running.  This increases the size of the binary considerably, and
	  should only be used when doing development.  If you are doing
	  development and want to debug BusyBox, answer Y.

	  Most people should answer N.

config STATIC
    bool "Build static binary (no shared libs)"
    default n
    help
    If you want to build a static binary, which does not use
    or require any shared libraries, enable this option.
    Static binaries are larger, but do not require functioning
    dynamic libraries to be present, which is important if used
    as a system rescue tool.

config PIE
    bool "Build position independent executable"
    default n
    depends on !STATIC
    help
    Hardened code option. PIE binaries are loaded at a different
    address at each invocation. This has some overhead,
    particularly on x86-32 which is short on registers.

    Most people will leave this set to 'N'.

	If you want to build this with a cross compiler, then you
	will need to set this to the cross-compiler prefix, for example,
	"i386-uclibc-".

	Note that CROSS_COMPILE environment variable or
	"make CROSS_COMPILE=xxx ..." will override this selection.

	Native builds leave this empty.
